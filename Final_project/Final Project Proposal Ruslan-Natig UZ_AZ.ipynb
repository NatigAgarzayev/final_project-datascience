    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Climate change stands as one of the most pressing challenges of our era, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the future of our planet. The accelerating pace of environmental shifts, characterized by rising temperatures, erratic weather patterns, and biodiversity loss, poses a profound threat to ecosystems, livelihoods, and global stability. These changes reverberate across continents, impacting communities, economies, and the delicate balance of nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these complexities, the challenge lies not only in comprehending the breadth and depth of these changes but also in deciphering their complex interconnections. The lack of a comprehensive understanding of the evolving climate landscape interferes effective decision-making, and perpetuates vulnerabilities among communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the problem at hand lies in the fragmentation and lack of comprehensive analysis of environmental data, hindering our ability to grasp the multifaceted dimensions of climate change."
